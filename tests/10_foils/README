That is nice test to show some weak spots of the naive PIC methods.

Original wave has TM polarization (E field parallel to surface and is
perpendicular to the plane of simulation), so wave is reflected nicely
w/o dispacing a particles.


Additional simulation shows that for the case of TE polarization we have
much worse situation â€“ perturbation moves into the foil, reaches rear
surface and triggers SELF-HEATING ISNTABILITY there. 

In order to show that the main cause is the sharp gradient of the charge
density I added few different slabs of plasma to make gradient smooth,
and observed much smaller nonconservation of energy.

You can uncomment different rear foils to see for yourself.
