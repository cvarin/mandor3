[units]
@ 1.0		Positive => works as wavelengh in microns [10^-4 cm].
		Negative => works as critical electrons' density [cm^-3].

[mesh]
@ 400		imax: mesh size along X axis
@ 400		jmax: mesh size along Y axis
@ 0		kmax: mesh size along Z axis
@ 40.0e0	Lx:   domain size along X axis
@ 40.0e0	Ly:   domain size along Y axis
@ 40.0e0	Lz:   domain size along Z axis
@ -0.6		tau: positive => unit is femtoseconds;
                     negative => unit is c/sqrt (1/h1^2 + .. + 1/h3^2)).

[boundaryConditions]
@ 2		xMin
@ 2		xMax
@ 2		yMin
@ 2		yMax
@ 0		zMin
@ 0		zMax

  Type of boundary condition is:
    0 - periodic;
    1 - mirror;
    2 - Mur's first order absorbing boundary condition.

[TFSF]
@ 60		TF/SF interface position (X).
@ 200		TF/SF interface position (X).
@ 100		TF/SF interface position (Y).
@ 300		TF/SF interface position (Y).
@ 0		TF/SF interface position (Z).
@ 100		TF/SF interface position (Z).
@ playBackward	TF/SF interface regime (record, playForward, playBackward).

[TFSF: open faces]
> xMax 		Removes xMax face.
> yMin 		Removes yMin face.
> yMax 		Removes yMax face.

  Helps to remove one or more faces without doing some cut-plane manipulations.
