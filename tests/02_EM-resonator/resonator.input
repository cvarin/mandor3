  Type of boundary condition is:
    0 - periodic;
    1 - mirror;
    2 - Mur's first order absorbing boundary condition.

[EMResonator]
@ Yee_2nd_order	Type of the dispersion equation ('physical' or 'Yee_2nd_order').
@ +1		mx = k_x*L_x/pi.
@ +1		my = k_y*L_y/pi.
@ +1		mz = k_z*L_z/pi.
@ Ex		Polarization of the wave (non-zero component of the electric field).
@ 5.0		E0 (electric field amplitude).
