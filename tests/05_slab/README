That is core test of the particle module. 

Testing steps:
    o charge conservation test activated with predefined keys in Makefile;
    o you can see if boundary conditions are fine;
    o you can test charge conservation '∂ρ/∂t + div j = 0';
    o than you can test Gauss law 'div E = 4πρ'.
    
      --------------------------------------------------------------
        Accuracy always should be NUMERIC, i.e. or order of 1e-14!

Notes on results:
    o the most usefull are random particles which hit every cell with every
      angle, but the only usefull outcome is a number;
    o to show something I ran simulation with 'solid' body with one boundary
      periodic, one mirror, and one absorbing as shown below.
