  During the test of parallel/serial part please make sure problem
  is well defined. Starting simulation from noise is NOT a well defined
  simulation because of application/compiler do not care about round-off
  mistakes and stuff like that.

[units]
@ 1.0		Positive => works as wavelengh in microns [10^-4 cm].
		Negative => works as critical electrons' density [cm^-3].

[mesh]
@ 120		imax: mesh size along X axis
@ 0		jmax: mesh size along Y axis
@ 0		kmax: mesh size along Z axis
@ 6.0e0		Lx:   domain size along X axis
@ 6.0e0		Ly:   domain size along Y axis
@ 6.0e0		Lz:   domain size along Z axis
@ -0.90		tau:  time step

[boundaryConditions]
@ 0		xMin
@ 0		xMax
@ 0		yMin
@ 0		yMax
@ 0		zMin
@ 0		zMax

  Type of boundary condition is:
    0 - periodic;
    1 - mirror;
    2 - Mur's first order absorbing boundary condition.

[DF:two-stream]
@ 1.0e-1	gamma_WE (growth rate of the electrostatic field energy) = \sqrt {rho*q/M}
@ -1.0		q/M (parameter to pin-point charge density)
@ 1200		Nx
@ 1		Ny Number of particles (total one!)
@ 1		Nz
@ 1		mx 
@ 0		my  Wave numbers of the desired mode (affect speed of beam and direction)
@ 0		mz 

[plasmaWave]
@ 1		Wave number along X.
@ 0		Wave number along Y.
@ 0		Wave number along Z.
@ 1.0e-10	Amplitude of the velocity perturbation.
