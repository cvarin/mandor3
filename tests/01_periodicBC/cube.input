[units]
@ 1.0		Positive => works as wavelengh in microns [10^-4 cm].
		Negative => works as critical electrons' density [cm^-3].

[mesh]
@ 20		imax: mesh size along X axis
@ 30		jmax: mesh size along Y axis
@ 20		kmax: mesh size along Z axis
@ 1.00e0	Lx:   domain size along X axis
@ 1.50e0	Ly:   domain size along Y axis
@ 1.00e0	Lz:   domain size along Z axis
@ -0.8		tau:  time step (negative means that unit is the marginally stable time step).

[boundaryConditions]
@ 0		xMin
@ 0		xMax
@ 0		yMin
@ 0		yMax
@ 0		zMin
@ 0		zMax

  Type of boundary condition is:
    0 - periodic;
    1 - mirror.
    2 - Mur's first order absorbing boundary condition.

[EMWave]
@ Yee_2nd_order	Type of the initialization (physical or Yee_2nd_order).
