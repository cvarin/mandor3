Multiple beams are created by writing them all in separate passes and
than joining corresponding TFSF sources. 

It includes many boring computations, so Python script is written to
automate stuff and to let you use multiple input units (for example, you
can set time in microns or length in femtoseconds).

Basic recording steps:

    o create 'record.cfg' with the setup of final run: 
        + all sources
	+ position of TF/SF interface
    o run 'recorder' script and examine input files for each source
    o run 'laser.rec_all.sh' script to record all sources (number of CPUs to 
      use can be set in the script)
    o run the actual simulation using laser.play.input as a base to create
      the complete setup (you will have to add foils and so on)

   =============================================================      
   WARNING: each call to 'recorder' OVERWRITES ALL CONFIG FILES!
            All your changes WILL BE LOST!
   =============================================================      
   
There are two ways to handle this inconvinience:

1) Write complete setup in 'recorder.cfg' file, so even if you will call
   recorder accidentally, nothing will be lost. It also keeps everything
   in just on file.
   
   Remember to remove all extra tags from the generated files used to write
   the sources!
   
2) Do not use 'laser.play.input' directly, only copy the generated info from
   the one into the real file.
   
Everything could be scripted trivially, so there are no point to
disscuss it anymore.
