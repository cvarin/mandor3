[units]
@ 1.0		Positive => works as wavelengh in microns [10^-4 cm].
		Negative => works as critical electrons' density [cm^-3].

[mesh]
@ 300		imax: mesh size along X axis
@ 300		jmax: mesh size along Y axis
@ 0		kmax: mesh size along Z axis
@ 30.0e0	Lx:   domain size along X axis
@ 30.0e0	Ly:   domain size along Y axis
@ 30.0e0	Lz:   domain size along Z axis
@ -0.8		tau:  time step (if negative that means [t] = 1/sqrt (1/h1^2 + .. + 1/h3^2))

[boundaryConditions]
@ 2		xMin
@ 2		xMax
@ 2		yMin
@ 2		yMax
@ 0		zMin
@ 0		zMax

  Type of boundary condition is:
    0 - periodic;
    1 - mirror;
    2 - Mur's first order absorbing boundary condition.

[gaussSpot]
@ -1.0		positive => I [W/cm^2] / negative => eE/mc\omega.
@ 1.0		Cyclic frequency [omega_0]. Must be 1 (or you understand what do you do).
@ 15.0		Focus X coordinate [micron].
@ 15.0		Focus Y coordinate [micron].
@ 15.0		Focus Z coordinate [micron].
@ 5.0		Gauss-spot width (FMHW for laser intensity) [micron].
@ 8.0		Pulse duration (FMHW for laser intensity) [fs].
@ 15.0		Pulse offset [fs].
@ 1		EY != 0
@ 1		EZ != 0
