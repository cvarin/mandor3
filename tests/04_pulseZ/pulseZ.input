[units]
@ 1.0		Positive => works as wavelengh in microns [10^-4 cm].
		Negative => works as critical electrons' density [cm^-3].

[mesh]
@ 0		imax: mesh size along X axis
@ 0		jmax: mesh size along Y axis
@ 300		kmax: mesh size along Z axis
@ 5.0e0		Lx:	  domain size along X axis
@ 5.0e0		Ly:	  domain size along Y axis
@ 5.0e0		Lz:	  domain size along Z axis
@ -0.9		tau:  time step

[boundaryConditions]
@ 0		xMin
@ 0		xMax
@ 0		yMin
@ 0		yMax
@ 1		zMin
@ 1		zMax

  Type of boundary condition is:
    0 - periodic;
    1 - mirror;
    2 - Mur's first order absorbing boundary condition.

[planePulse]
@ 2		axis (0 - X, 1 - Y, 2 - Z)
@ 0.5		initial coordinate
@ 3.5		final coordinate
@ 1.0		|E| amplitude of the field (if it is negative propagation directed is negative)
@ 2		p:   polarization of the wave (0 - plane, 1 - S, 2 - P)
