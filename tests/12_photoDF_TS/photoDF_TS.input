[seed:two-stream]
@ 2.00e-06	amplitude of the electric field perturbation.
@ 1		start m_z wave number.
@ 1		stop m_z wave number.
@ 0.05		cut-off of the spectrum with respect to gamma (for this instability max gamma ~ 0.3)
@ +0.0e0	phase shift type:
                  [0, 2.0) => direct setting of phase's value in [pi]
		  < 0      => random phase (white noise)
