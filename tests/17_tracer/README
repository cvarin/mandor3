Simple test to illustrate the purpose of 'tracer' diagnostic.

USAGE
-----
'./tracer -v': exports all trajectories into 'output/tracer/*.vtk' files.

'./tracer file1.csv file2.csv ...': updates record #000 (selects markers).


CSV FILES
---------
One can make the 'csv' (comma-separated value) files using paraview 
by selecting and saving the data generated by 'distiller' tool. See 
test '17_tracer' for additional info.

Example of such file is './marker.csv'.
