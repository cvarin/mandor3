[focused laser]
@ 1.0e+22	Poynting vector at the best focus 	{1}

@ 0.0		Phase shift.
@ 10.0		R to mirror radius ratio, where E_incident = A·exp(-(y²+z²)/R²).
@ +1		Direction of propagation (positive – along X,
                                          negative – in opposite direction).
Footnotes:
  {1}   Positive means intensity I [W/cm²]; negative means E₀ [e·E/(m·ω·c)].
  {2}   = F_mirror/D_mirror; the smaller the number, the tighter the focusing.
        The value has to be greater then 0.25.
  {3}   Defined as FWHM (Full Width at Half Magnitude) of intensity.
        Pulse is gaussian.
  {4}	Pulse leading front offset (leading edge to pulse max delay).
