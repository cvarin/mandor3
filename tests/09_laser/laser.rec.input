[units]
@ 1.0		Positive => works as wavelengh in microns [10^-4 cm].
		Negative => works as critical electrons' density [cm^-3].

[mesh]
@ 800		imax: mesh size along X axis
@ 400		jmax: mesh size along Y axis
@ 0		kmax: mesh size along Z axis
@ 80.0e0	Lx[microns]:   domain size along X axis
@ 40.0e0	Ly[microns]:   domain size along Y axis
@ 40.0e0	Lz[microns]:   domain size along Z axis
@ -0.95		tau: positive => unit is femtoseconds;
                     negative => unit is c/sqrt (1/h1^2 + .. + 1/h3^2)).

[boundaryConditions]
@ 2		xMin
