  Some comments:

- Coordinates may be
  'x', 'y', 'z', 
  'vx', 'vy', 'vz', 
  'e', 'e_fast', 
  'thetaZ', 'phiZ'. 

- postfix _fast means that approximate expressions are used to speed-up processing.

- 'e' means energy in eV.

- number of parameters(axises) can be 1, 2 and 3, for example:
  o 1D energy distribution:
    @ 'e'  in [0.0e+0,   8.0e+3], 60 bins
    
  o 2D phase plane (y, vy):
    @ 'y'  in [0,  6], 60 bins
    > 'vy'  in [-3.0e+0, 3.0e+0], 60 bins

  o 3D phase plane + energy (x, vx, e):
    @ 'x'  in [0,  6], 60 bins
    > 'e'  in [0,  1e7], 60 bins
    > 'vx'  in [-3.0e+0, 3.0e+0], 60 bins

- thetaZ and phiZ are shperical coordinate angles with respect to Z-axis in degrees.
