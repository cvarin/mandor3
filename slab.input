  This simulation used to check boundary conditions in current density 
  evaluation procedure. Use it with activated option -DMC_GAUSS_TEST and 
  others debug checks in Makefile.
  
[units]
@ 1.0		Positive => works as wavelengh in microns [10^-4 cm].
		Negative => works as critical electrons' density [cm^-3].

[mesh]
@ 20		imax: mesh size along X axis
@ 20		jmax: mesh size along Y axis
@ 20		kmax: mesh size along Z axis
@ 2.0e0		Lx [micron]:   domain size along X axis
@ 2.0e0		Ly [micron]:   domain size along Y axis
@ 2.0e0		Lz [micron]:   domain size along Z axis
@ -0.95		tau:  time step

[boundaryConditions]
@ 1		xMin
@ 1		xMax
@ 0		yMin
@ 0		yMax
@ 0		zMin
@ 0		zMax

  Type of boundary condition is:
    0 - periodic;
    1 - mirror;
    2 - Mur's first order absorbing boundary condition.

[plasma]
@ 1		nx.
@ 1		ny.
@ 1		nz.
@ 1		Particles per point (velocity layers).
@ boxes		Cuts out a small box.
