Distiller is particles diagnostic.

Frontend is Python script 'distiller' located together with other
compiled executables (../../ from here). It takes input file and
generates './distiller.c' to be compiled as shared library (dll).

Usage of Python simplifies interaction with user (nice command line
interface, flexibility of input file syntax, and so on).

Dll is experimental solution - later I may change it to complete
generation of few C files and recompilation of the setup/distiller
executable.
