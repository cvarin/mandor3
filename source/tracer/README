That is backend to the 'tracer' diagnostic used to select any particle for
detailed tracing through the simulation.

Frontend is Python script 'tracer' located together with other
compiled executables (../../ from here). It takes comma-separated files
generated by paraview and delivers them to the 'o/mark_trajectory.out' file
it compiles if necessary.

Another backend (trace2vtk) converts binary files to the vtk files located in
'output/tracer' folder.
