That is code blocks I took from ScPIC, Canadian fork of early Mandor code, made
by Konstantin Popov [http://www.phys.ualberta.ca/~kpopov/scpic.html]. 

Changes, becides obvious rerefactoring and restyling, are heavy. The most
important are:

1) Twice faster Stratton-Chu integration due to simultaneous computing of
   real and imaginary parts of the integral (reuses ALL heavy functions).

2) Calibration of Ey amplitude in focal spot is done ANALITICALLY. Details
   are on site [XXX], but key idea is simple --- 'Ey' depends on 'tau'
   (phase shift) as 'exp(i*tau)' [proof on site]. So we easily derive
   both amplitude and phase shift analytically from one call to 'focused_ey'.
   It saves about nine seconds of run time, with bonus numerical accuracy.


CREDITS AND OTHER CRAP
======================
Just in case you can have both codes, and want to start working with both.

The MK code and it's descendant ScPIC is Mandor after:
  + stripped MPI parallelization
  + extreamly heavy refactoring to produce the single compact executable 
  + heavy refactoring of all IO and user interfaces
  + completely independent implementation (by Kostya) of 
     * OpenMP parallelization
     * moving window
     * soft source corresponding to laser beam focused by parabolic mirror,
       to paraxial source, and to a plane wave.
     * ionization (didn't test ionization for now, though, cannot say anything)

Messaging subsystem, mesh subsystem, and core algorythms
  + Yee solver
  + current distribution with exact charge conservation
  + Boris solver
  + VSP balancing?
are only restyled.
